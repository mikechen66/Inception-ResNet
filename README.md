# Inception-ResNet-TF2

It is the pure model of Inception ResNet v2. It has been built with the basic modules of 
tensorflow.keras. It almost completely complies with the official Inception ResNet paper. 

The official slim model is hard to be understood due to redundant lines of code and lack 
of clarity. Furthermore, the model in Keas library also inlcude puzzling code. So it is a 
new attempt to go back to the simplicity, elegance and power.
